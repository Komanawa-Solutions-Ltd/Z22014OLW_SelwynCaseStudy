\subsection[Site Results]{Results for Individual Sites} \label{sec:site_results}

Although we have produced results and figures for each site, it is beyond the scope of this report to discuss the detection power of each site; however all figures are available in the \gls{proj_repo}.
An example of the individual site detection power plots is shown in \autoref{fig:ex_plot}.
The figure details the detection power of site M36/3588 assuming a 30\% reduction in nitrate concentrations.
There are two subplots; for both the x-axis is the sampling duration/date.
For the top plot the y-axis is \gls{no3n} concentration (mg/l).
The raw sample data and whether those data were included in the analysis (blue included, red/black not included), the predicted source concentration (yellow), the predicted receptor concentration with (gold) and without the implemented reduction (fuchsia) are all plotted.
In the lower subplot the y-axis depicts the likelihood that a change in nitrate concentrations will be detected.
The color of the line represents the sampling frequency (e.g. monthly, quarterly, etc.).
Note that the black/grey line is the detection power assuming that the receptor has no \gls{no3n} noise.
Effectively, the black/grey line is when the change would be detected if only lag was considered.
The correct interpretation of this plot is that the lag at this well only allows a theoretical change detection at or after 2027 (grey line).
However, if we consider the obscuration of noise, then with quarterly sampling the detection power is only likely to exceed 80\% in 2037 (gold line).
We use the cutoff of 80\% as it is typically used nationally and internationally as the acceptable threshold for confidently drawing conclusions and/or making decisions from the monitoring results interpretation \citep{dumont_determining_nodate}.

\subsubsection[Plateau Sites]{Plateau Sites: Sites Where \gls{no3n} Concentrations Will Not Decrease Under the assumed Pathway} \label{sec:plateau_results}

\input{tables/plat_tab}

Some sites will not show a statistically robust decreasing trend under the assumed pathway.
We refer to these sites as plateau sites. An example of a plateau site is shown in \autoref{fig:ex_plateau}.
Well L35/0205 is a plateau site because the steep increasing trend in concentration in combination with the significant \gls{mrt} suggest that the source and receptor concentration are at a significant disequilibrium.
Therefore, the rather minor reductions (10\%) in the assumed pathway will simply lower the eventual steady state concentration (e.g., gold vs fuchsia lines), but will not reduce the concentration below the observed initial concentration (sen slope fit in 2017).


These plateau sites can cause a significant challenge in detection of nitrate leaching reductions.
Our knowledge of equilibrium nitrate concentrations in the absence of nitrate loss reductions is poor.
This makes it difficult to understand the cause of any difference between a future observed steady state concentration (once concentration levels off) and the predicted steady state concentration (e.g., the fuchsia line in \autoref{fig:ex_plateau}).
The differences could be due a number of factors (see \autoref{sec:intro}) as well as, on the ground actions not actually being implemented and/or inaccuracies in the estimate of steady state concentration.
These sites will require more sophisticated statistical analysis (for instance a counter-factual approach) to determine whether the \gls{pc1} nitrate loss reductions have been effective.

\autoref{fig:plateau_locs} shows the location of these plateau sites and the required reduction to yield a decreasing \gls{no3n} slope in the receptor.
Note we did not include the surface water features here as there is too much uncertainty surrounding their \gls{mrt}.
For the red shaded sites nitrate concentrations would only expect to decline in the well if the average nitrate loss reduction in the monitoring well capture zone is greater than 5\% otherwise the \gls{no3n} concentrations will plateau at a lower level than if no reductions had occurred.
If an average nitrate loss reduction of 10\% is assumed, nitrate concentrations in the fuchsia, gold and blue shaded sites would all plateau at some point in the future, with no measurable decrease occurring.
\autoref{tab:plateau} shows the percent of the groundwater network that will not show a decrease in \gls{no3n} concentrations at a given reduction level in the source.
For example, 57\% of the groundwater network will not show a decrease in \gls{no3n} concentrations if the source is reduced by 5\%.
This suggests that the \gls{pc1} reductions may not yield steady state concentrations below 2017 concentrations for a significant portion of groundwater network; however this is not necessarily a failure of \gls{pc1} as concentrations were expected to continue to increase after the implementation of \gls{pc1}, but to achieve an average concentration of <8.5 mg/l.

\subsection[Mean Residence Time Impacts]{Mean Residence Time, Steady State Concentration, and Detection Power} \label{sec:mrt_results}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{breakawaybox}[
        label={box:wierdresults}]{Counterinuitive Results}
        Some of the results here are counterintuitive; for instance, in \autoref{fig:sw_mrt} the detection power is higher with a \gls{mrt} of 10 years than with a \gls{mrt} of 5 years. Additionally, for some receptors (not pictured) the detection power increases and then subsequently decreases with increasing sampling duration.

        This odd behaviour is due to the statistical method used. Fundamentally we are fitting a Mann-Kendall test to the data and specifying success as p<0.05. A rapid change (low lag and/or a swift implementation period) pared with infrequent sampling can lead to the receptor reaching steady state before the statistical test can confidently detect the reduction. The ensuring long flat period, where the true receptor concentration is not changing, leads to a higher p-value in the statistical test and therefore lower detection power. In these instances another statistical test (e.g., a counterfactual approach), maybe a more robust method to detect the change. This is discussed in \autoref{sec:counterfactual}.
    \end{breakawaybox}
\end{wrapfigure}

Our use of a set of indicative \gls{mrt} values for surface water features demonstrates the impact that uncertainties in the age distribution impacts both detection power of a receptor, and its steady state \gls{no3n} concentrations.
\autoref{fig:sw_mrt} demonstrates the impact of the assumed \gls{mrt} on the estimation of the steady state \gls{no3n} concentration in Harts Creek.
Harts creek is a small spring-fed tributary of Te Waihora (Lake Ellesmere) on the southwestern side of the lake.
There a substantial historical record of increasing \gls{no3n} concentrations, but there are no data on the age of the water within the creek.
Our simple source concentration modelling (see \autoref{subsec:detection_power_methods}) and the measured nitrate concentration data prior to 2017 suggest that the peak steady state concentrations in the receptor (without reductions) could range between 7.6 to 12.0 mg/l \gls{no3n} depending on the \gls{mrt} assumed.
This large range is significant from a water resource management perspective --- the maximum possible value is beyond the drinking water limit.
Concentrations in spring fed streams above the drinking water limit would imply that water supply wells in the steam catchment are, on average, likely to exceed the limit.
In addition, the nitrate loss reductions required to achieve the national bottom line nitrate concentration in the stream vary widely between these two estimates, which has important implications for farming in the stream catchment (though as noted this threshold postdates \gls{pc1}).

The uncertainty in the likely maximum peak concentration in this receptor could be significantly constrained with one or more relatively cost-effective age tracer samples.
It is also worth understanding that in surface water features \gls{mrt} may not be a static value, but may vary with stream flow with higher flows, where runoff is a higher percentage of the flow, having a younger \gls{mrt} than base flows where more of the stream flow is likely derived from older groundwater.

\kslfig {0.95\textwidth}{../figures/mrt_matters.png}{The impact of assumed \gls{mrt} on the steady state \gls{no3n} concentrations and the potential to detect \gls{pc1} reductions (red.)}{sw_mrt}{For example, if \gls{mrt} to the river site is less than 5 years, a decreasing trend would be observed, but if the MRT is 30 years then legacy nitrate will still be in transit and concentrations continuing to increase before they plateau.}

The \gls{mrt} is also a significant factor for detecting \gls{pc1} \gls{no3n} reductions.
If the \gls{mrt} is relatively low (5-10 years) then it would be feasible to detect \gls{pc1} reductions by 2032 with the current (monthly) or slightly higher sampling frequency.
A higher \gls{mrt} of 20 years would significantly reduce detectability and with a \gls{mrt} of 30 years, the \gls{pc1} nitrate loss reductions are unlikely to result in a decrease in \gls{no3n} concentrations (see \autoref{sec:plateau_results}) relative to their 2017 concentrations.
Note that the counterintuitive result that the detection power with \gls{mrt} of 5 years is lower than that of \gls{mrt} 10 years are discussed in \autoref{box:wierdresults}.

\subsection[Network Detection Power]{Network Level Detection Power} \label{sec:network_results}
\kslfig {0.95\textwidth}{../GeneratedData/geospatial_plots/detect_power_locs_red20_freq4}{Sampling duration until the probability of detecting a reduction is $\geq80\%$ }{timetodetect}{}


\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.45\textwidth}
    \begin{breakawaybox}[label={box:sfreq}]{Historical mean well sampling frequency}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Annually - Biannually}: 27 sites
        \item \textbf{Biannually - Quarterly}: 10 sites
        \item \textbf{Quarterly +}: 9 sites
        \item \textbf{46 sites total}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{breakawaybox}
\end{wrapfigure}

\autoref{fig:network20} shows the sampling duration required to detect \gls{pc1} nitrate loss reductions (assuming a 20\% reduction) with 80\% probability using quarterly sampling.
The black dashed line in \autoref{fig:network4per} shows the percentage of the network which can detect \gls{pc1} reductions assuming that the true receptor concentration (i.e., with no noise) is known.
This analysis includes the effects of lag, but excludes the obscuration of the reductions by \gls{no3n} variability / noise and therefore represents the upper limit of change detection potential for very low (zero) noise sites or at very high sampling frequencies.
\autoref{fig:timetodetect} provides a geospatial representation of \autoref{fig:network20} and the 20\% subplot of \autoref{fig:network4per}.
In combination these figures shows that the vast majority of the groundwater network will not be able to detect \gls{pc1} reductions with quarterly sampling.
Increasing the sampling frequency can significantly increase the detection power of the network, but the detectability is constrained by the lag component - time needs to pass before we can identify the reductions.

These results are consistent with the observation that very few monitored wells in the catchment currently have a statistically significant reducing trend (only 3 of 46 sites in this study, and only 9 of 102 sites for which we were originally provided data by \gls{ecan}).
Given our results, the lack of reducing \gls{no3n} concentrations cannot distinguish whether or not \gls{pc1} reductions have been successfully implemented.
If we assume a full 20\% \gls{no3n} reduction in all the source zones, then of the 46 groundwater sites in this study, only 30 sites will have any decreasing \gls{no3n} concentrations(see \autoref{sec:plateau_results}).
At current quarterly sampling rates, it will likely take until 2062 before 15 sites (50\% of those that we modelled as having decreasing \gls{no3n} concentrations) will have a statistically significant reduction in \gls{no3n} concentrations.
Increasing to weekly or monthly sampling would improve the detection power of the network, and we could expect detection in those 15 sites by 2042 and 2037, respectively.
However, any increase in sampling frequency would require a proportional increase in resource for the monitoring programmes.

\autoref{fig:network4per} shows the effect of different reductions on detection power with a quarterly sampling frequency.
Note that these figures exclude the plateau sites (see \autoref{sec:plateau_results} and \autoref{tab:plateau}).
If we assume 10\% reductions on average in the source zone, then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nearly 50\% of the network wells will never measure a decreasing \gls{no3n} concentration.
    \item With quarterly sampling we would not expect to see evidence of a 10\% reduction (via a decreasing trend) in more than 10\% of the remaining network and not until after 2050.
    \item Increasing sampling frequencies to monthly or weekly would significantly improve the probability of detection these changes(\autoref{fig:network10}). Note that increasing sampling frequency will not impact the plateau sites.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection[Counterfactual Approach]{The Benefits of a Future Counterfactual Approach} \label{sec:counterfactual}

The analysis presented here is designed to answer the question: \say{How long will it take to detect \textit{any} reduction in \gls{no3n} at our existing receptors?} This is a useful question, but it is not the only question that can be asked.
For example, we could ask: \say{How long will will we need to monitor to determine whether a 20\% concentration reduction has occurred?} or \say{How long before we can determine whether or not we are on track for at least a 10\% \gls{no3n} reduction?}.
These questions require a different statistical approach --- a counterfactual approach.
Essentially, the question answered by a counterfactual approach is: \say{How long until we are confident that pathway 1 (e.g. no reduction) and pathway 2 (e.g., 10\% reductions) are significantly different?}.
A counterfactual approach has not yet been implemented in the groundwater detection power calculator \citep{dumont_komanawagw_detect_power_2023}, but it is being developed and will be available by mid 2024.
It is worth noting that any uncertainty in the source concentration (i.e., at the base of the root zone), which is typically uncertain, is more likely to yield additional uncertainty in the counterfactual detection power.
This is because the absolute difference between two pathways is important under a counterfactual approach whereas only the relative change is necessary for the `reduction` detection power approach presented in this report.

Finally, it should be noted that neither the approach presented here nor the counterfactual approach can reliably determine whether a specified concentration reduction has occurred: a steady state receptor nitrate concentration at the time the reduction is implemented would be required for this. Depending on the distribution of the water age, it can take significantly longer than the \gls{mrt} for a receptor to reach steady state with current land use.

\subsection[Possible Network Improvements]{How to Improve the Detection Power of the Existing Network}

Our results suggest that the current monitoring programme is unlikely to detect whether the \gls{pc1} \gls{no3n} reductions have been implemented successfully in the short to medium term under the current monitoring frequency.
It may be possible to reduce the monitoring duration required to detect change via bespoke monitoring at new sites with a low \gls{mrt} and low signal/noise ratio.
Of course sufficient sampling, and thus time, would be required at any new site.
Although reducing \gls{no3n} concentrations in any new site would provide confidence that \gls{no3n} concentrations are going in the right direction (down), the results could not prove that the changes were due to \gls{pc1} because these reductions have, theoretically, already been implemented.
Some young groundwater could already be approaching steady state with respect to the \gls{pc1} nitrate loss reductions.
This means that, depending on the \gls{mrt}, a zero change in concentration could be consistent with successfully implemented \gls{pc1} reductions.

Instead, we suggest that the best approach to improve the unambiguous detection of \gls{pc1} reductions is to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Increase the certainty of the \gls{mrt} estimates in groundwater detection network; only c. 30\% of groundwater sites had a \gls{mrt} assessment (e.g., via tritium). The remaining 60\% were estimated from nearby wells, which introduces a significant amount of uncertainty. Further age assessments would significantly improve the certainty of the network's detection power and allow increased frequency sampling to occur at sites which are likely to detect the change.
    \item Increase sampling at selected sites that this analysis (or additional analysis with additional \gls{mrt} assessments) show a suitably high probability of detecting \gls{pc1} reductions.
    \item Similar to 1. the surface water network has a significant amount of information about the catchment and acts as an integrator of water quality from a much larger sample of land within the Te Waihora catchment. This alleviates some of the challenges of the spatial representativeness of the groundwater network \citep{olw_guidance}; however the utility of this information is thwarted by the lack of \gls{mrt} assessments. Understanding the age distribution and the relationship between the age distribution and river/stream stage/flow would unlock the power of these sites and support design of an optimized and integrated water quality monitoring programme.
    \item Finally, more sophisticated statistical analysis could be used to extract more information from the existing data and significantly reduce the time required to determine whether the \gls{pc1} plan rules and associated land management actions are successfully reducing nitrate concentrations.
\end{enumerate}



Importantly, the current network is used for more than just change detection.
In some cases these alternative uses are directly in conflict with change detection.
For instance, if the purpose of the network is to provide a broad understanding of the state of the aquifer, then it is essential to monitor deep bores with longer lags to provide an accurate picture of that portion of the aquifer.
These bores by their very nature will never be ideal for rapid change detection.
Our suggestions are specifically for improving the detection power of the network for the purpose of detecting \gls{pc1} reductions or similar actions in the future.
A monitoring programme must be fit for the specific purpose for which they are designed and we cannot comment on the overall quality of the network.

\section[Limitations]{Limitations}

This work has a number of limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Many of the \gls{mrt} estimates are based on estimates from nearby wells. This introduces a significant amount of uncertainty into the \gls{mrt} estimates.
    \item The \gls{mrt} estimates are based on a simple 1D mixing models and are therefore uncertain.
    \item We have not included any signal decomposition in our analysis of the \gls{no3n} noise. More complex modelling of the observed \gls{no3n} concentrations could significantly improve the detection power of the network; however this likely requires more frequent sampling than is currently available.
    \item We have assumed that the source concentration has a single monotonic trend. This is unrealistic and may yield an under or overestimate of the steady state concentration.
    \item Our assessment of the quality of the monitoring programme is solely based on the use case of detecting \gls{pc1} or similar reductions. The network has many more uses, and we cannot comment on the overall quality of the network.
    \item We have not assessed the spatial representativeness of the network, which was beyond the scope of this project.
\end{itemize}
